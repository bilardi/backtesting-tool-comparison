* analyze your trades by indicators, your scripts and perform your backtesting
* share your analysis with other traders and investors, because it is a full-fledged social network

For implementing your indicators or your strategies, Tradingview has own script language: `Pine <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/>`_.

For using Pine,
