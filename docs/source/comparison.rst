Comparison
##########

The comparison is for evaluating which language or system you could use based on:

* maintenance of packages
* learning curve / costs
* performance
* monitoring

In this tutorial, there have been used some languages and systems:

* `R <https://backtesting-tool-comparison.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r/index.html>`_
* `Python <https://backtesting-tool-comparison.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/index.html>`_
* `Pine <https://backtesting-tool-comparison.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pine/index.html>`_
* MQL4

You could know another language or system that it is perfect for your needs.
This is only a discussion to highlight key points, bottlenecks and risks.
